This is where all data is stored

combined_parliament_reports is not used by the application but was for the notebooks
dockerfile and init-mongo.sh - check if mongodb has data in it and if not will populate it automatically
also includes raw data

Recommend running via docker (see details in parliamentary_insights/README.md)
